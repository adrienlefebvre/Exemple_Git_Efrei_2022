# David Guetta

## Let's love

I will never leave your side, my love <br>
Standing right beside you is enough <br>
Count on me if you feel any pain <br>
Call to me, I'll run to you again <br>

You can count on me <br>
And I can count on you <br>
You show up, like I show up <br>
And I'll keep showing up for you <br>
